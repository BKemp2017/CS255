Welcome to my GitHub repository that showcases my work in system analysis and design! In this repository, you will find two important documents from my two projects for this course. From Project One, I have included the Business Requirements Document, and from Project Two, I have included the System Design Document.

The DriverPass project was the focus of these documents. The client was a driving school that wanted to implement an online platform for scheduling, booking, and managing driving lessons for its students. The system that we designed was a web-based application that allowed students to easily book and manage their driving lessons, while the driving school could manage the scheduling and payments.

I believe that I did a good job of interpreting the client's requirements and incorporating them into the system design. I paid attention to the details and was able to create a comprehensive and well-structured system.

If I had to choose one part of my work to revise, it would be the implementation of user feedback. I think I could have done a better job of incorporating user feedback into the design. In the future, I would improve this by involving users in the design process earlier on and conducting usability tests throughout the development process.

Interpreting the user's needs is crucial when designing a system because it ensures that the system meets the user's requirements and expectations. In this project, we conducted interviews and surveys with potential users to understand their needs and preferences. We then incorporated their feedback into the design, which led to a more user-friendly system.

When designing software, I approach it by first understanding the problem that the software is meant to solve. I then gather requirements from stakeholders and users and conduct research to understand the context and environment in which the software will be used. Finally, I use different techniques and strategies, such as prototyping and user testing, to create a design that meets the requirements and is user-friendly.

Overall, I am proud of the work that I have done on these documents and the system design. I believe that they showcase my ability to collect requirements, design a system, and incorporate user feedback. Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
